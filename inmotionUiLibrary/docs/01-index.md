# This UI library uses **Atomic Design** Principles.

Atomic Design is a methodology for creating design systems in a hierarchical and systematic way. It breaks down the UI into fundamental building blocks. The main levels in Atomic Design are:

1. **Atoms**: The basic building blocks of a UI, such as buttons, inputs, and labels.


2. **Molecules**: Groups of atoms bonded together to form a functional unit, like a search bar (input field + button).


3. **Organisms**: Complex components composed of molecules and atoms, such as a header or a form.


4. **Templates**: Page-level structures that include groups of organisms arranged in a layout.


5. **Pages**: Specific instances of templates, populated with real content.
